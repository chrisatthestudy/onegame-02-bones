# Bones - OneGameAMonth - February 2013

## Overview
This was my second submission for the OneGameAMonth challenge for 2013, and my
first Javascript game, which is why it is deliberately simple.

The object of the game is simply to reach a certain total within a set limit
of dice rolls. Each "turn" rolls six dice and adds them to the running
total. Up to two dice can be "frozen" so that they will not be rolled on the
next turn but will instead keep their current value.
